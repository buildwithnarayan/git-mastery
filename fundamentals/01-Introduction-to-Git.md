# Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

* Understand what Git is.
* Understand why Git was created.
* Recognize the problems Git solves.
* Explain the importance of Version Control.
* Understand where Git is used in the software industry.

# What is Git?

**Git** is a **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS)** that helps developers track changes in their source code, collaborate with other developers, and maintain the complete history of a project.

Instead of creating multiple copies of files like:

```text
Project
Project_Final
Project_Final_v2
Project_Final_Latest
Project_Final_Really_Final
```

Git stores every change in an organized history, allowing developers to revisit previous versions, compare changes, and collaborate efficiently.

# Why Was Git Created?

Before Git became popular, software teams often managed project versions manually.

Imagine a team of five developers working on the same application.

Developer A edits the Login module.

Developer B edits the Dashboard.

Developer C fixes a production bug.

Without version control, everyone shares files manually.

Very quickly the project becomes difficult to manage.

Questions like these become common:

* Which file is the latest?
* Who changed this code?
* When was this bug introduced?
* Can we restore yesterday's version?
* How do we combine everyone's work safely?

Git was created to solve these problems.

# A Real-World Example

Imagine your team is building an Employee Management System.

Without Git, the project folder might look like this:

```text
EmployeeSystem
EmployeeSystem_Final
EmployeeSystem_Final_v2
EmployeeSystem_Latest
EmployeeSystem_Backup
```

After a few weeks, no one knows which folder contains the correct version.

With Git, there is only **one project**, and every change is recorded as a commit with information about:

* What changed
* Who made the change
* When it changed
* Why it changed (through commit messages)

---

# Why Developers Love Git

Git offers several powerful capabilities:

* Tracks every change made to the project.
* Allows multiple developers to work simultaneously.
* Makes it easy to recover previous versions.
* Supports experimentation using branches.
* Enables safe collaboration through Pull Requests.
* Integrates with platforms such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.

---

# Where is Git Used?

Git is used in almost every modern software project, including:

* Software Development
* Web Development
* Mobile Applications
* DevOps
* Cloud Engineering
* Infrastructure as Code
* Open Source Projects
* Data Engineering
* Machine Learning

Today, Git is considered an essential skill for developers, DevOps engineers, QA engineers, and cloud professionals.

# Key Terminology

| Term              | Meaning                                         |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Repository        | A project managed by Git                        |
| Commit            | A saved snapshot of your project                |
| Branch            | An independent line of development              |
| Merge             | Combining changes from different branches       |
| Remote Repository | A repository hosted on platforms such as GitHub |

Do not worry if these terms are unfamiliar. Each one will be covered in detail in later chapters.

# Hands-on Exercise

Install Git on your computer and verify the installation.

```bash
git --version
```

Example output:

```text
git version 2.x.x
```

# Common Beginner Mistakes

❌ Thinking Git and GitHub are the same.

❌ Believing Git automatically backs up your project online.

❌ Creating multiple copies of a project instead of using version control.

❌ Assuming Git is only for developers.
