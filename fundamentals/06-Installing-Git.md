# Why Do We Need to Install Git?

Git is a command-line application that runs on your local computer.

Before you can track changes, create commits, or collaborate with others, Git must be installed and available from your terminal.

---

# Installing Git

## macOS

Using Homebrew (recommended):

```bash
brew install git
```

Verify the installation:

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Windows

1. Download Git from the official website.
2. Run the installer.
3. Keep the default installation options if you're unsure.
4. Open **Git Bash** or **PowerShell**.

Verify:

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git
```

Verify:

```bash
git --version
```

---

# Expected Output

Example:

```text
git version 2.51.0
```

> Your version may be different depending on when you install Git.

---

# Updating Git

Keeping Git updated gives you:

* Bug fixes
* Performance improvements
* New features
* Security updates

How you update Git depends on your operating system and package manager.

For example, on macOS with Homebrew:

```bash
brew update
brew upgrade git
```

---

# Verify Your Installation

Run the following commands:

```bash
which git
git --version
git --help
```

On Windows, replace `which` with:

```bash
where git
```

These commands confirm:

* Where Git is installed
* Which version is installed
* That Git is functioning correctly

---

# Real-World Example

Imagine you join a new company.

One of your first setup tasks is installing development tools:

* Git
* VS Code
* Java
* Docker
* Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)

Git is usually the first tool configured because almost every project depends on it.
